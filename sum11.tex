\section{Introduction}

The \Cyclus project at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is the
result of lessons learned from experience with previous nuclear fuel
cycle simulation platforms. The modeling paradigm follows the
transacation of discrete quanta of material among discrete facilities,
arranged in a geographic and institutional framework, and trading in
flexible markets. Key concepts in the design of \Cyclus include open
access to the simulation engine, modularity with regard to
functionality, and relevance to both scientific and policy
analyses. \textbf{The combination of modular encapsulation within the
  software architecture and an open development paradigm allows for a
  balance between collaboration at multiple levels of simulation
  detail and security of proprietary or sensitive data.}

%% The current version is an object oriented C++ application with XML-based pre-processing.

When comparing different nuclear fuel cycle concepts, it can be a
challenge to find any two systems analyses that compare across a
common set of metrics with a similar set of underlying assumptions.
Each analysis is likely to focus on a set of metrics that are of
interest to the team performing the analysis and involve both implicit
and explicit assumptions and constraints about the behavior of the
fuel cycle system.  While a strict prescription of these metrics,
assumptions and constraints could be proposed for comparison purposes,
another solution is to provide a systems analysis simulation tool that
provides sufficient modularity, extensibility and open access, that it
can be a basis for harmonzing to a common set.  If it becomes easier
to modify an existing simulation tool to support the needs of a new
analysis than it is to develop a new tool, then it is possible that
such a tool will be adopted more universally for such analysis.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%----------%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Modeling Paradigm}

The modeling paradigm adopted by \Cyclus includes a number of
fundamental concepts which comprise the bedrock on which other, more
flexible, design choices have been made. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Discrete Materials and Facilities}

The \Cyclus modeling infrastructure is designed such that every
facility in a global nuclear fuel cycle is treated and acts
individually. While modeling options will exist to allow collective
action, this will be as a special case of the individual facility
basis. Each facility has two fundamental tasks: the transaction of
goods or products with other facilities and the transformation of
those goods or products from an input form to an output form.  For
example, a reactor will receive fresh fuel assemblies from a fuel
fabrication facility, transform them to used used fuel assemblies
using some approximation of the reactor physics, and supply those used
fuel assemblies to a storage facility.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Market-based Material Transactions}

The transaction of nuclear materials takes place in markets that act
as brokers matching a set of requests for material with a set of
offers for that material. A variety of market models will be available
to perform this brokerage role. It is important to note that each
market is defined for a single commodity and acts independently of
other markets. Once the requests and offers have been matched by each
market in a simulation, the facilities exchange material objects.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Region-Institution-Facility Hierarchy}

Many times in a fuel-cycle simulation, parameters describing
relationships between facilities are required. For instance, one may
wish to account for the presence of a contract between two facilities,
or one may wish to model two facilities operated by the same
entity. Accordingly, \Cyclus implements this ability via a
Region-Instituion-Facility hierarchy. Every discrete facility in
\Cyclus is considered to be owned by an institution that operates in a
geographic region.  An institution can be used to represent any entity
that may own and operate a facility such as a private corporation, a
government agency, or a non-governmental organization, among others.
A region can be used to represent any geographic area, typically a
politically relevant area such a sub-national region (e.g. a
U.S. State), a nation-state, or a supranational
region (e.g. the E.U.).  While some performance parameters of the
facility may depend on its institutional ownership or geographical
location, this capability is more useful in modeling the way in which
a facility engages in a market for trade of nuclear material based on
its ownership entity and/or region.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%----------%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Software Architecture and Development}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Dynamic Module Loading}

The ability to dynamically load independently constructed modules is a
heavy focus of \Cyclus development. Dynamically-loadable modules are
the primary mechanism for extending \Cyclus' capability. The primary
benefit of this approach is encapsulation: the trunk of the code is
completely independent of the individual models. Additionally, any
customization or extension is implemented only in the loadable
module. A secondary benefit of this encapsulation is the ability for
contributors to choose different distribution and licensing strategies
for their contributions. By allowing models to have varied
availability, the security concerns of developers can be
assuaged. Finally, this strategy allows individual developers to
explore different levels of complexity within their modules, including
wrapping other simulation tools as loadable modules for \Cyclus. This
last benefit of dynamically-loadable modules addresses another goal of
\Cyclus: ubiquity amongst its potential user base. By engineering
\Cyclus to easily handle varying levels of complexity, a single
simulation engine can be used by both users keen on big-picture policy
questions as well as users interested in more detailed, technical
analyses.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Open Development Paradigm}

\Cyclus obeys an open development paradigm that utilizes current best
practices in distributed code development and facilitates
inter-institutional collaborations. The \Cyclus development framework
employs a modern, open source philosophy that ensures transparency,
attracts contribution from a varied community of collaborators, and
guarantees institution-independent access to all potential users.

A public source-code repository provides unhindered access to the
fundamental simulation framework and basic fuel-process models
volunteered by developers. Granting unfettered access only to the
\Cyclus engine allows for separation of the source code from any input
data, thereby allowing secure and proprietary model developers to be
similarly encouraged to utilize the \Cyclus framework. This modern
development model passively distributes specialized content to
interested research groups, and facilitates parallel model development
efforts by institutions with complimentary goals. The transparency
inherent in this type of open source development path also facilitates
code review by exposing available content to verification and
validation by collaborators with diverse areas of specialization and
levels of expertise.

This process also benefits from the ability to identify and utilize
third-party, open-source libraries when such libraries provide
necessary additional functionality. Thus far, such libraries have been
used to provide basic infrastructure functionality such as file
input/output, as well as model-specific capabilities for advanced
network flow optimization. An indepently developed integer programming
module is an example of one such addition.

\section{Conclusions}

The above sections outline a proposed fuel cycle simulation platform
currently under development at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison. \Cyclus presents an effective framework for transparent,
accessible, yet compartmentalized code development. Its software
architecture and modeling paradigm promises to maximize ease of use,
ease of contribution, technical utility, and relevance to both
technical and policy-based inquiries, which may represent an optimal
way forward for the next generation of nuclear fuel cycle modeling.
